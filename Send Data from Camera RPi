# Sending data from the Camera RPi
# This program will enable the raspberry pi connected to the motion sensor and camera module to send data collected from the camera
# to another raspberry pi; allowing it to display it. The RPi connected to the motion sensor will then send a signal to the other RPi if 
# the motion sensor detects something.
